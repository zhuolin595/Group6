This project studies the profitability of strawberry production in the United States. 
We cleaned and organized the raw USDA data, then analyzed four main factors related to profit: 
acres bearing, price per CWT, production value, and utilized production. 
The goal was to understand how farm size, market price, output value, and actual sold production influence profit per acre.
After cleaning the dataset and filling missing values, we estimated costs using a fixed rate of $30,000 per acre. 
The analysis showed that higher prices and greater utilized production lead to higher profitability, 
while larger farm size does not always increase efficiency.
